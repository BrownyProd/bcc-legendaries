>This is a simple easily configurable Legendary Animal Hunting Script for RedM.

## Features

- Can create your own hunts
- Gives rewards when the player skins the animal
- Can enable or disable enemy npcs during the hunt

- Everything is easily configurable in the Config.lua

## How it works
- You can set up the hunter(the location you go to start hunts) coordinates in the Config.lua and when you go there you will find an npc and some text. Do what the text says to open the hunt menu.

- VORP Utils
- VORP Inventory

## Installation Steps

## Side notes
- Credit to vorp_hunting that is where i pulled the skinned.js and skinned.lua from and modified it to do what I want here.
- If you are adding new hunts in the config.lua please only use Legendary Animal models otherwise it could lead to duping bug
- This has a built in skinning system so if you have legendary animals setup in your hunting script remove them from the hunting script
- I will offer support for this, however do note it is not garunteed
- I really hope you enjoy the script thanks for trying it!
- I have optimized this code quite alot, but if you see any code that can be optimized further please open a pull request and I will take a look if it works I will merge it. Or just tell me lol.
- You can edit the code obviously. All I ask is that you release the edits to the community freely.
